# Employee Management Web Application

the application we created is an ASP.NET Core MVC web application that manages employee data. It includes the following features:

1-Employee Model: We defined an Employee model with attributes such as ID, name, age, salary, address, and email.

2-SampleData: We created a SampleData class with a static list of employees to serve as sample data for the application.

3-EmployeeController: We implemented an EmployeeController with two actions:

GetById: Retrieves an employee by their ID and displays their details.
GetAll: Retrieves all employees and displays them in a table format.
Views: We created corresponding views for each action (GetById.cshtml and GetAll.cshtml) to display the employee details and the list of employees, respectively
